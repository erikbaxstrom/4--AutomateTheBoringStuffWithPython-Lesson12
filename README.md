# 4--AutomateTheBoringStuffWithPython-Lesson12
An attempt at the lesson 12 project as described in the first couple minute of the video, without looking at the code. 

A simple guessing game that:
Asks for your name
Says "welcome \<name\>, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20"
"take a guess"
\[user inputs guess\]
Guess is validated
Program responds to each guess
* too high
* too low
* "good job, it took you \<number of guesses\> tries."

If you don't guess in six tries, it tells you "Nope, the number was \<number\>
